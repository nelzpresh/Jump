              <p>An amateur diver out for an expedition off the coast of Norfolk recently stumbled upon an exciting ecological find less than 300 yards from shore. The diver, Dawn Watson, was swimming in just over 20 feet of water when she came upon massive tree trunks lying on the ocean floor, some with branches spanning over 26 feet, Reuters reported. <a class="jump" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/10000-year-old-forest-has-been-discoveredunder-water-180954089/" target="_blank">Read More</a>.</p>

                <h3>Fold Mountain</h3>
                <p class="article">By Encyclopedia</p>
                <p>Fold mountains are created where two or more of Earth’s tectonic plates are pushed together. At these colliding, compressing boundaries, rocks and debris are warped and folded into rocky outcrops, hills, mountains, and entire mountain ranges. Fold mountains are created through a process called orogeny. An orogenic event takes millions of years to create a fold mountain, but you can mimic it in seconds. <a class="jump" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fold-mountain/" target="_blank">Read More</a>.</p>

                <p class="article">By Farser Cain</p>
                <p>The interior of the Earth is hot enough to melt rock, and that’s just what happens. Melted rock squeezes together into vast pools of magma beneath the ground. Since it’s less dense than the surrounding rock, it makes its way upward to the surface. If the magma reaches the surface you get a volcano; with the ash, and the lava and the explosions. But if the magma pushes up but doesn’t actually crack through the surface, you can get a dome mountain.<a class="jump" href="https://www.universetoday.com/29827/dome-mountains/" target="_blank">Read More</a>.</p>

                <h3>Volcanic Mountain</h3>
                <p class="article">By Farser Cain</p>
                <p>Feel the ground. It’s nice and cool, right? Well, dig down a few kilometers and things really heat up. Once you’re down more than 30 km, and temperatures can reach more than 1,000 degrees C; that’s hot enough to melt rock. The melted rock is called magma, and it collects into vast chambers beneath the Earth’s surface. The molten rock is less dense than the surrounding rock and so it “floats” upwards through cracks and faults. <a class="jump" href="https://www.universetoday.com/29836/volcanic-mountain/" target="_blank">Read More</a>.</p>

                <h3>Plateau Mountain</h3>
                <p class="article">By National Geographic</p>
                <p>Plateau are Sculpted by geologic forces that lift them up and the wind and rain that wear them down into mesas, buttes, and canyons. Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon, both icons of the American Southwest, were chiseled from the Colorado Plateau. Plateaus are built over millions of years as pieces of Earth's crust smash into each other, melt, and gurgle back toward the surface. <a class="jump" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/plateaus/" target="_blank">Read More</a>.</p>
